Other highlights include Sierra Gordas primary health care programme and rural health centre. Antofagasta Minerals operations seek to improve local employment prospects through specific hiring initiatives and job-training programmes. To achieve this we have focused on developing the skills of local companies, to help improve their commercial, financial and human resource capabilities, as well as their productivity and use of innovation. In 2018, highlights include the inauguration of the Los Vilos Technical Training Centre, the Antofagasta Minerals Scholarship Programme and Eleva Programme, as well as a series of initiatives to develop capabilities. More information on p. 38 The hiring of local people is at the heart of our business strategy to contribute to local development and it is a requirement that has been included in contracts with supplier and contractor companies through a performance agreement which sets local employment targets. In 2018 we directly employed 2,226 people from Antofagasta and Coquimbo Regions, representing 43% of our employees. At Los Pelambres, employees and contractors from Choapa Province account for 46% of the total workforce. Millions of $ in purchases of goods and services net of VAT in Antofagasta and Coquimbo Regions|1,929|350|377| Inaugurated in 2018, this is the first Technical Training Centre in the town of Los Vilos. The modern higher education institution was built with funds from Los Pelambres and is operated by the Catlica del Norte University through its technical training centre CEDUC. More than 300 students enrolled in the six courses offered, all from local communities and the vast majority were able to benefit from the countrys gratuity law which provides free further education to poorer families. The diploma aims to increase and strengthen the leadership skills of social leaders in Salamanca municipal district. The training programme was provided by the Social Leaders Diploma Corporation (Corporacin Diplomado de Dirigentes Sociales) and accredited by the University of Santiago. 124 people from both urban and rural areas graduated from the course, of which 66% were women. In 2018 34 young people taking technical-professional and university courses benefited from this scheme, of which 70% were women. They all came from the Mara Elena, Michilla, Sierra Gorda and Calama areas. Of these, 20 received the grant for the first time while it was renewed for the remaining 14. 1 Figures for 2018 represent Antofagasta Minerals total purchases through local suppliers from Coquimbo and Antofagasta Regions according to the following definition: local supplier is a supplier company that has facilities in any of the municipal districts of a specific region, and may have its headquarters or a branch installed in this region. At Antofagasta Minerals we believe it is possible to mine in a sustainable way through effective environmental management that prioritises environmental protection and the efficient use of natural resources. Antofagasta Minerals believes effective environmental management contributes to the efficient use of natural resources, biodiversity protection, mitigation of negative environmental impacts, first- rate operational performance, development of regions where we operate and protection of the ways of life and livelihoods of our host communities. This is no easy task due to the different factors we must handle. These include the development of our business activities, our activities potential environmental impacts from exploration until mine closure, and the new climate change scenario to which we must adapt. These challenges motivate us to continue improving the effectiveness of our management and thus contribute to the sustainable development of our operations area of influence. At Antofagasta Minerals, we have a Sustainability Policy and an Environmental Management Model that seek to ensure our operations, environmental activities and projects strictly comply with environmental requirements1 and have no incidents with an impact on the environment. The Environmental Management Model focuses on four areas: leadership, incident reporting, operating risk management and regulatory risk management. We have specific standards on significant environmental issues such as climate change, biodiversity, mine closure and water management. The general manager of each mining operation is responsible for environmental issues and reports to the Board. The corporate environmental department is responsible for controls, monitoring and incident reporting. Environmental performance is reported monthly to the Executive Committee and every six months to the Boards Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Committee. Environmental performance is included in performance agreements and represents 5% of annual targets. In 2018 significant progress was made in implementing visible leadership, with on-site visits by the Executive Committee and each operations senior leadership teams, as well as in the reporting of environmental incidents. The latter seeks to create a preventive and learning culture. In 2018 the number of low-potential environmental incident reports increased by 91% compared to 2017 as a result of training, communication and the standardisation of criteria for issuing reports. In Chile, mining projects are evaluated by the environmental evaluation service SEA and must comply with a set of specific commitments to prevent, mitigate or compensate for their potential impacts, including on water, air, soil, biodiversity as well as use of energy and water. These commitments are set out in legally binding contracts known as RCAs2 and are audited by the Environmental Superintendency (SMA) on a regular basis. Non-compliance can result in fines or even revocation of operating permits. Environmental commitments are managed in an environmental requirements management system on a platform for the whole mining division. Antofagasta Minerals has a total of 61 RCAs listing 7,145 environmental commitments. We received no environmental fines in 2017. The Los Pelambres Expansion Project was approved in 2018, generating a new RCA and environmental commitments. It is currently under construction. 1 The most important environmental institutions in Chile are the Ministry of Environment which sets out public policy; the Environmental Evaluation Service SEA (Servicio de Evaluacin Ambiental) which assesses and qualifies project impacts; the Environmental Superintendency SMA (Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente) which inspects and controls; and the environmental courts which, through the judiciary, apply the General Environment Law and its associated regulations. 2 Resolucin de Calificacin Ambiental (Environmental Qualification Resolutions). We have a Corporate Integrated Closure of Mining Operations Standard in place since 2016 that considers the physical and chemical stability of the facilities as well as environmental and social issues. It also provides tools for timely and effective closure planning, approval by the authority and communication with the community. There are also guidelines on risk evaluation, social and environmental impacts, economic matters and post-closure guarantees, among other issues. All of our operations have closure plans approved by SERNAGEOMIN, the Chilean government agency responsible for this matter. Our mining operations have emergency response and action plans coordinated with public service and local authorities. Tailings deposits and other facilities are designed to resist earthquakes and extreme climate events. Mining activity generates particulate matter emissions. In Chile there are regulations that establish legal parameters for air quality which differ for urban and rural areas. Antofagasta Minerals operations proactively manage air quality through continuous operational measures to suppress dust and particulate matter emissions (eg dampening roads and ore stockpiles), and also have early warning and air-quality monitoring points defined with the authority. However, despite these measures, our controls are not always able to prevent particulate matter emissions from affecting neighbours. In July 2018, the communities of Valle Alto in Salamanca municipal district expressed their concern about an increase in dust from the sector between Los Quillayes tailings dam and Los Pelambres. Although we have worked collaboratively since 2008 to control and minimise the generation of particulate matter, as defined in the Framework Agreement (2008) and Cuncumn 2030 commitment plan (2015), the communities believed it necessary to agree additional activities or modifications. In this context, the communities, local authorities and Los Pelambres signed a document enabling agreement in principle to be reached on a petition of 11 points relating to particulate matter control measures presented by the communities and to generate the basis on which to begin a dialogue process centred on transparency and good faith. Through dialogue with the community, a series of technically feasible measures were jointly developed to mitigate and improve controls of particulate matter. These measures were embodied in an agreement signed in October 2018 between Cuncumn and Batuco communities and Los Pelambres. To date, implementation of the agreed measures is in line with the work plan agreed with the community. These include the construction of a dome to cover ore stockpiles which has been completed and was visited by community representatives and authorities when finalising this report in May 2019. Water is necessary for life and human activities; it is also an essential element to produce copper. Efficient water management must contribute to maintaining the balance between water availability and its use by all parties that coexist in a region, both now and in the future. Water is an essential resource for productive process in mining as well as the development of other human activities. The mining industry uses 3% of total water consumption in Chile1. Although the mining industry is not one of the main water users, it is useful to understand the land-use context of mining operations to assess the different water management challenges. In our case, we have three mining operations  Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldvar  located in northern Chile and one operation  Los Pelambres - in central Chile. Each region has different water-related challenges although those of climate change and mining sustainably are common to both. All these variables need to be incorporated into our water management system to obtain a better grasp of water issues, establish necessary controls, improve processes and performance, and contribute to solutions for future challenges. In 2018 Antofagasta Minerals adopted ICMMs Water Stewardship Framework to reinforce our management of water resources. The Water Stewardship Framework is based on four key elements: Be transparent and accountable: Publicly report material water risks, management activities and performance. Engage proactively and inclusively with stakeholders to understand their priorities, share plans and collaborate on solutions. Adopt a catchment-based approach understanding the social, cultural, economic and environmental value of water at the catchment scale to identify material water stewardship risks and provide context for corporate and operational water management. Effective water resource management: Manage operational water (quantity and quality) inputs, use and outputs to maximise resource sustainability, operational flexibility and economic benefit. Within this framework, during the year we reviewed our organisational water management structure. Our new Operational Model describes water management roles and functions. We also 1  Forecast water consumption in copper mining 2017-2028, Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco), 2017. 2 Our report to CDP is publicly available at www.cdp.net held workshops at each of our mining operations with the Risk and Compliance area to identify at risk water resources. This led to the development of a risk matrix with respective controls. The general manager of each operation is responsible for water issues and reports to the Board. The corporate environmental department is responsible for controls, monitoring and incident reporting. Since 2012, we have reported our water management performance in the water chapter of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)2. In recent years our different water challenges have led us to focus on the strategic and efficient planning of water resources that will be necessary to continue our processes on an annual basis, as well as on the incorporation of technologies to minimise continental water use to reduce water consumption per tonne of copper produced. As a mining group we have promoted the use of sea water, developing technologies for its raw use in ore processing operations. In 2018, 45% of our total water consumption came from the sea, significantly higher than 9% a decade ago, when only Michilla used sea water, and also than the Chilean mining industrys average sea water use of 14%1. Remaining consumption came from surface water (25%), groundwater (29%) and supplied by third parties (1%). Water reuse rates vary between 80% and 96% depending on the characteristics of each operation. This is higher than the Chilean mining industrys average reuse rate of 75%2. In 2018 we consumed a total of 67.2 million m3 of water, 2% more than the previous year, mainly due to the increase in ore processed. The main loss of water is through natural evaporation from the tailings deposits. We conduct participatory monitoring to ensure water quality outside our sites; in the case of Los Pelambres with the local community. In 2018, we conducted monitoring at 160 points  both ground and surface water  in the Choapa Valley and in the port area. At Centinela and Antucoya, water quality is monitored in the vicinity of the port facilities and at Zaldvar, we monitor groundwater extraction points in Negrillar, close to the Salar de Atacama. In 2018 we carried out a series of water resource protection initiatives at Los Pelambres. Some of the best examples of this are the Aproxima and Confluye programmes, as well as the training of social leaders on rural drinking water issues. In addition, we are conducting a pilot project to help protect the accelerated melting of glaciers. More information on p. 59 1-2  Source: Minera en nmeros 2017, Consejo Minero (Mining in numbers 2017, Mining Council). 3  In 2017 we began implementing the ICMM Water Reporting Guide. The calculation considered factors such as water retained in ore moisture, water at bottom of the pit (ground water according to ICMM methodology), as well as rainfall and run-off (continental water according to ICMM methodology). In the face of climate change, mining not only plays a role as a supplier of copper to promote new low-carbon technologies but also presents a challenge to the industry to decarbonise its production of copper. We will achieve our goals of reducing carbon emissions by incorporating renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our processes. Antofagasta Minerals energy use represents almost 21% of cash costs  made up of 14% electricity and 7% fuel  and most of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a direct link between energy use and GHG emissions when energy is generated from fossil fuels. Chiles energy policy aims to decarbonise its energy matrix. It has set a target for renewable energy to represent 70% of its energy mix by 2050 and provided economic incentives to reach this goal. In 2018 renewable energy represented 47%1 of the countrys energy matrix. We can make a unique contribution towards these efforts not only because copper is vital for clean energy technologies but also by using renewable energy in our processes and decoupling our energy consumption from GHG emissions. Mining is also very sensitive to the effects of climate change. In recent years we have all been affected by extreme weather events, such as heavy snow, floods and droughts, leading us to adopt an adaptive approach to climate change and focus efforts on technology and innovation. In 2018 Antofagasta Minerals Executive Committee approved an updated structure and governance of its Energy Management System. The update emphasises energy management as a key variable to be considered in different initiatives across the organisation including innovation, operational excellence, competitiveness and costs, and as a mechanism for GHG reduction. This involved making adjustments to management structures based on ISO 50001 guidelines and establishing the basis for the new systems operation. For this purpose, we began different key tasks such as preparing consumption profiles for each operation, analysing the portfolio of Operating Excellence projects to determine the projects contribution to reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions, and defined KPIs to measure new projects. 1  Report on Installed Generation Capacity, National Energy Commission, Chile. In addition, in 2018 we continued to drive energy efficiency initiatives including increased performance at the Los Pelambres SAG mill, specific energy consumption improvements at the Centinela electrowinning plant, fuel-use and mining truck utilisation efficiencies at Zaldvar and the evaluation of crusher utilisation rates at Antucoya. In 2019 our tasks are to prepare an electromobility roadmap, create an online corporate energy portal, develop and promote standards that incorporate energy efficiency into project designs and strengthen the governance structure through the Operating Model and highlight energy as an important variable to be considered in decision-making. goal for 2022 is equivalent to removing around 80,000 vehicles from the roads. tricity consumption12,513,335 11,906,112 1G1L,5A3C8,I4E5R4 consumptioInn 1g1a,9s6ta2,s22I6nn9o,v4a9t1io,7n21Bo9,a1r5d3,a70p4p btivecote ewable energy consumption23%21%17% useimatn e. The effects of climate change have become evident in Chile in recent years mainly affecting water availability in the centre and north of the country where Antofagasta Minerals operations are located. In 2016 the Board approved a Climate Change Standard. The standard has three main aims: Incorporate climate change into organisational culture. Consider GHG emissions in decision-making from the initial design stage of projects until closure. Include GHG mitigation measures, detecting opportunities at operations in electricity supply decisions and project energy efficiencies. In 2018 Antofagasta Minerals also defined a target to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 300,000 tonnes by 2022 compared to the baseline in 2017. The Board is responsible for climate change issues and the corporate environmental department for its management. In addition, since 2009 we have reported our climate change management to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).1 In 2018, 23% of Antofagasta Minerals energy supply came from renewable energy. At Los Pelambres, one of the worlds largest copper mines, 59% of energy consumption comes from photovoltaic plants, wind or power generated by its ore conveyor belts. As from 2018 new energy supply contracts favour sources that reduce GHG emissions. For example, the new electricity supply contract signed between Zaldvar and Colbn S.A. for 550 GWh/ year will supply renewable energy from July 2020. Zaldvar will be the first Chilean mining company to use 100% renewable energy to produce copper, which will be verified by an external organisation. Another GHG emission reduction initiative is the power increase at Centinelas thermosolar plant which uses solar energy for heating processes at its electrowinning plant. In 2018 carbon emission intensity decreased by 17% compared to the previous year, mainly due to the combination of the northern SING and central SIC grids. Before the combination, our northern operations obtained electricity from what is now the SING subsystem in which conventional energy sources make up 79% of installed capacity. Our operations now obtain electricity from the national electric system (SEN) in which renewable energy makes up 47% of installed capacity. 1  Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is the leading organisation in the monitoring and disclosure of companies carbon and water footprint. More information on www.cdp.net 2 Figures include 100% of Zaldvar emissions although Antofagasta plc owns 50% of the mining operation. 3  Scope 1: Sources of direct emissions in operations controlled by Antofagasta Minerals S.A., such as from machinery, vehicles or boilers. 4 Scope 2: Indirect emissions from electricity generation activities by sources that are owned or controlled by a third party associated with the consumption of energy inputs eg electricity bought from SEN. This public-private tailings deposit initiative, developed under the auspices of the Programa Nacional de Minera de Alta Ley and managed by Fundacin Chile, aims to strengthen preventative operational management, reduce the perception of risk and improve incident response and communication between the different parties in the event of emergencies.

One of the consequences of mining is the generation of material which is deposited in waste rock dumps, spent ore dumps and tailings storage facilities. There are around 700 tailings storage facilities in Chile of which 124 are in operation1. Chiles national geology and mining service SERNAGEOMIN is responsible for inspecting waste disposal facilities, together with other technical bodies  such as the water authority (DGA)  in the regions where mining operations are located. We have four tailings storage facilities in operation: two at Los Pelambres, one at Centinela and one at Zaldvar. They have all been designed with high safety standards, constructed using the downstream method, and are regularly monitored by independent, qualified experts. We also participate in international and public-private alliances to strengthen tailings management at local and global level. which is deposited in tailings storage facilities, waste rock dumps and spent ore dumps, as well as other industrial waste. Each type of waste is managed in accordance with current regulations and with additional measures to protect the safety and health of people and avoid pollution of the soil, and surface and underground water. Antucoya, Centinela Cathodes and Zaldvar mainly generate waste in the form of spent ore from their operations while Los Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates generate tailings; in all cases, waste rock dumps are required. The general manager of each mining operation is responsible for mining waste and reports to the Groups Board. The corporate environmental department is responsible for controls, monitoring and incident reporting. Since 2015, we have improved communication and warning systems with the community, particularly at the Mauro tailings storage facility. 1  Atlas of Tailing Deposits of Chile  Sernageomin, Chile. Available in Spanish at: http://relaves.sernageomin.cl/#/home Innovation has been a priority for Antofagasta Minerals to achieve new and safe forms of storing tailings. At Centinela, we operate a thickened tailings storage facility. This innovation provides significant benefits such as greater physical stability than conventional tailings and enables us to recycle more water to be reused in productive processes. At Los Pelambres we operate the Mauro and Los Quillayes storage facilities (the latter is used as back-up) which were designed to meet high Chilean safety standards and go beyond these in some aspects of their operation. Mauro has 76 water pressure devices (piezometers) to monitor in real time its stability and safety. In September 2015 the Mauro tailings deposit withstood an 8.3 magnitude earthquake 100 km away, the strongest earthquake in the region in more than 70 years. It suffered no negative impacts and continued to operate normally. After the 2015 tailings dam collapse in the district of Bentos Rodrigues de Mariana in Brazil, the mining industry through ICMM reviewed the critical controls for these facilities, which included ensuring the availability and development of qualified and competent human resources. Our tailings storage facilities are reviewed twice a year by a group of independent international experts who assess their condition and management, and report directly to the CEO and Board. As an ICMM member, we support recent proposals to develop an independent, international system of managing tailings deposits. We also actively participate in the ICMM working group on the matter which has two main lines of action: Short term (less than 10 years): Strengthen critical controls for the design, operation and closure of conventional tailings deposits (to be prepared during 2019) and, within a period of no more than 10 years, significantly improve the management of tailings storage facilities and the implementation of ICMMs Position Statement on tailings. Long term (10 to 15 years): This involves two lines of work. First to investigate and identify alternative methods of ore recovery to significantly reduce and/or eliminate tailings generation. Second, to promote the development of technologies to eliminate moisture from tailings and thus strengthen their geomechanic properties. We also participate in the Consejo Mineros (Mining Council) tailings working group which is focused on facilitating implementation of the ICMMs Position Statement in Chile and preparing a guide to develop emergency procedures. The waste rock we remove to extract ore and the spent ore we generate through the leaching process are stored in specially prepared areas within our facilities. In Chile, the location, operation and closure of dumps must be authorised by the environmental authorities and by SERNAGEOMIN. Our processes produce hazardous industrial waste, such as used oil and batteries, and non-hazardous waste, such as sludge and timber. All are managed in accordance with legal requirements. Whenever possible, we recycle waste to avoid its final disposal. In addition to Chiles strict existing regulations on waste, Law 20,920 came into force in 2017 which established a waste management framework, extended the responsibility of the producer and promoted recycling, which included tyres as a priority waste. Protecting biodiversity and valuable environmental ecosystems. Los Pelambres is located in Coquimbo Region in one of the worlds 25 areas of greatest plant biodiversity, reflected in an abundance of flora and fauna. Our operations located in the Atacama Desert - Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldvar - are in an environment with less flora and fauna. Antofagasta Minerals has a Biodiversity Standard developed in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in 2016. It is aligned with the ICMMs position statement on Biodiversity and Protected Areas and aims to prevent and minimise impacts on biodiversity, appropriately restore and compensate for any such impact, and generate additional benefits in the surrounding area. All of our operations must conduct a review of biodiversity - species and ecosystems - according to the categories established by the Standard to prevent significant impacts and, if this is not possible, to minimise or compensate for them. Los Pelambres currently administers four Nature Sanctuaries in Coquimbo Region: Palma Chilena de Monte Aranda, Quebrada Llau Llau, Laguna Conchal and Cerro Santa Ins. Laguna Conchal is a coastal wetland with a high conservation value and a highly unique habitat for the establishment and development of terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal life. Los Pelambres has administered it since 1997 with the aim of restoring and protecting the environment. 14 sites in Chile and the only one managed by a private company. The sanctuary is located 4 km north of Los Vilos and covers 50.4 hectares (the surface area of the RAMSAR site is 34 hectares). In 2018, a new environmental management plan was developed together with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and approved by the Ministry of Environment that will further strengthen this sites environmental richness. In 2018 we contributed to the protection of about 27,000 hectares of high-conservation land through a management model, allowing us to safeguard its conservation and strengthen its rich biodiversity. Santa Ins is a 714-hectare coastal site which has one of the last remnants of relict rainforest, meaning that it contains plant and animal life that used to exist in the wider area but which has shrunk due to climate change. This nature sanctuary co- vers more than 5,696 hecta- res and has populations of the Palma Chilena (Jubaea chilensis), a threatened endemic palm species. Its conservation status is vul- nerable and it is regarded as one of the southernmost palms in the world. There are also almost 100 species of native flora and fauna, among other common and endemic species. Almost 1,800 hectares protect this sclerophyllous hard-leaved woodland ecosystem in the mediterranean-climate ecoregion found in central Chile. Its preserves some of the regions endangered species such as the Chequn (Luma chequen or white Chilean Myrtle) and the Canelo (Drymis winteri). Antofagasta Minerals65 incidents occurred. We have a set of indicators to measure and evaluate our sustainability performance. Some of these indicators are included in the business scorecards of each mining operation and our corporate offices while others are aspirational goals that we have defined to complement these targets. 1.1 Implemented according to plan and without delays. 1.0 Implement plan milestones without delays in accordance with Strategy. Regrettably one of our contractors at Los Pelambres had a fatal accident. We were unable to meet this target as a contractor suffered a fatal accident. However, the LTIFR remained at around 1.0. The implementation of the Diversity and Inclusion Strategy was executed during 2018 according to plan. 725,300 tonnes of copper. Closure plan for Los Pelambres Expansion Project approved. 705,000  740,000 tonnes of copper. Obtain approval of closure plan for Los Pelambres Expansion Project. Target achieved and 3% better than planned mainly due to higher revenues as a result of higher copper prices. Production target partially achieved (-2%), mainly due to lower than planned throughput and production.

There were no severe social incidents that affected our reputation and/or operational continuity. The compliance model was reviewed and rolled out across the organisation. The Groups risk appetite was defined and approved. Due diligence on Human Rights began. Review and communicate the Groups Compliance Model. Define the Groups risk appetite. Conduct due diligence on Human Rights. During the year, the Compliance Model was reviewed and its structure was updated. It was rolled out through a day workshop for executives, a corporate video and mass emails across the organisation. In 2019 a mass e-learning process is planned and specific training for more exposed areas. In 2018 the Board reviewed and approved the Groups risk appetite in the main risk areas, providing guidelines to the administration on how to analyse and control our main risks. Due diligence on Human Rights began at the end of 2018 at all our mining operations. The key issues reported in our Sustainability Report are defined through a formal Materiality Analysis process, involving Antofagasta Minerals CEO and executive team. For our 2018 Materiality Analysis, we conducted a review and update of the issues that were material to Antofagasta Minerals in 2017. The key issues were identified through the following activities: ∑ Strategic and priority issues for Antofagasta Minerals: these were identified through interviews with the CEO and the Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability. The Business Strategy, Sustainability Policy and Risk Matrix were also reviewed. ∑ Principal issues for external stakeholders: these were identified through a review of internal and external communications media, the latter mainly focused on the mining sector. Critical issues for specialist investors and analysts on sustainability were also identified. Emerging issues for the mining sector and companies in general: key emerging issues for Antofagasta Minerals were identified by reviewing different sources of specialist information. The most important issues identified were analysed and classified according to importance to stakeholders and the size of impact. The Materiality Matrix in the 2017 Sustainability Report was used as a basis for the evaluation as well as an assessment of the issues in the Risk Matrix. The main messages and audience to whom the Report is addressed were defined together with the CEO. Workshops were held with vice presidents and key executives on the management of material issues to define the management approach, initiatives and indicators to be highlighted. Achieving the Agenda 2030 targets will require cooperation between the State, local government, private sector and civil society. At Antofagasta Minerals, we seek to contribute to ethemepalocyhmieenvt eopmpoertnutniotiefsthfoer sloecagl oals through our operations, projects and programmes. Messrs. Shareholders and Directors Antofagasta Minerals S.A. We have reviewed the set of performance indicators contained in pages 76 to 79 of Antofagasta Minerals S.A.s 2018 Sustainability Report, hereinafter, Performance Indicators, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Antofagasta Minerals S.A.s management is responsible for the presentation of the Performance Indicators in accordance with the definitions established in the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI standards). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Performance Indicators based on our review.

       "'Komatsu Cummins, the municipalities of María Elena and Sierra Gorda, and development NGO Simón de Cirene. Through open and participatory processes with communities, it aims to generate a common roadmap to improve local people’s wellbeing. In 2018 initiatives agreed through the dialogue processes were implemented including programmes on Emergency Planning, responsible possession of animals, and alcohol and drug use prevention among young people in María Elena. In the case of Sierra Gorda, improvements were made to community infrastructure such as the church, nursery school and fire station, as well as programmes to renew fire equipment and support firefighters’ emergency management. Other highlights include Sierra Gorda’s primary health care programme and rural health centre. With the help of specialists, María Elena’s emergency response capacity was diagnosed, within the framework of the United Nations’ Awareness and Preparedness for Emergencies at Local Level (APELL) standard, in order to create an integrated emergency plan. The initiative involved training and certification of key institutions and players at local and regional level, as well as raising awareness and providing information to the community. The aim was to improve, coordinate and expand communication mechanisms in case of an emergency by strengthening the institutional framework of the municipality’s emergency operations committee, COE (Comité Operativo de Emergencias). Our partners in developing this initiative were María Elena municipality, Komatsu Chile, Distribuidora Cummins Chile, firefighters, police, health centre, Cruz del Norte hospital, Nueva Coya radio, neighbourhood committees, COE María Elena, Municipal Council, COE Tocopilla, national emergency office ONEMI, development NGO Simón de Cirene and Ideambiente. Antofagasta Minerals’ operations seek to improve local employment prospects through specific hiring initiatives and job-training programmes. To achieve this we have focused on developing the skills of local companies, to help improve their commercial, financial and human resource capabilities, as well as their productivity and use of innovation. In 2018, highlights include the inauguration of the Los Vilos Technical Training Centre, the Antofagasta Minerals Scholarship Programme and Eleva Programme, as well as a series of initiatives to develop capabilities. More information on p. 38 The hiring of local people is at the heart of our business strategy to contribute to local development and it is a requirement that has been included in contracts with supplier and contractor companies through a performance agreement which sets local employment targets. In 2018 we directly employed 2,226 people from Antofagasta and Coquimbo Regions, representing 43% of our employees. At Los Pelambres, employees and contractors from Choapa Province account for 46% of the total workforce. Inaugurated in 2018, this is the first Technical Training Centre in the town of Los Vilos. The modern higher education institution was built with funds from Los Pelambres and is operated by the Católica del Norte University through its technical training centre CEDUC. More than 300 students enrolled in the six courses offered, all from local communities and the vast majority were able to benefit from the country’s gratuity law which provides free further education to poorer families. The diploma aims to increase and strengthen the leadership skills of social leaders in Salamanca municipal district. The training programme was provided by the Social Leaders Diploma Corporation (Corporación Diplomado de Dirigentes Sociales) and accredited by the University of Santiago. 124 people from both urban and rural areas graduated from the course, of which 66% were women. In 2018 34 young people taking technical-professional and university courses benefited from this scheme, of which 70% were women. They all came from the María Elena, Michilla, Sierra Gorda and Calama areas. Of these, 20 received the grant for the first time while it was renewed for the remaining 14. 1 Figures for 2018 represent Antofagasta Minerals’ total purchases through local suppliers from Coquimbo and Antofagasta Regions according to the following definition: “local supplier is a supplier company that has facilities in any of the municipal districts of a specific region, and may have its headquarters or a branch installed in this region”. At Antofagasta Minerals we believe it is possible to mine in a sustainable way through effective environmental management that prioritises environmental protection and the efficient use of natural resources. Antofagasta Minerals believes effective environmental management contributes to the efficient use of natural resources, biodiversity protection, mitigation of negative environmental impacts, first- rate operational performance, development of regions where we operate and protection of the ways of life and livelihoods of our host communities. This is no easy task due to the different factors we must handle. These include the development of our business activities, our activities’ potential environmental impacts from exploration until mine closure, and the new climate change scenario to which we must adapt. These challenges motivate us to continue improving the effectiveness of our management and thus contribute to the sustainable development of our operations’ area of influence. At Antofagasta Minerals, we have a Sustainability Policy and an Environmental Management Model that seek to ensure our operations, environmental activities and projects strictly comply with environmental requirements1 and have no incidents with an impact on the environment. The Environmental Management Model focuses on four areas: leadership, incident reporting, operating risk management and regulatory risk management. We have specific standards on significant environmental issues such as climate change, biodiversity, mine closure and water management. The general manager of each mining operation is responsible for environmental issues and reports to the Board. The corporate environmental department is responsible for controls, monitoring and incident reporting. Environmental performance is reported monthly to the Executive Committee and every six months to the Board’s Sustainability and Stakeholder Management Committee. Environmental performance is included in performance agreements and represents 5% of annual targets. In 2018 significant progress was made in implementing visible leadership, with on-site visits by the Executive Committee and each operation’s senior leadership teams, as well as in the reporting of environmental incidents. The latter seeks to create a preventive and learning culture. In 2018 the number of low-potential environmental incident reports increased by 91% compared to 2017 as a result of training, communication and the standardisation of criteria for issuing reports. In Chile, mining projects are evaluated by the environmental evaluation service SEA and must comply with a set of specific commitments to prevent, mitigate or compensate for their potential impacts, including on water, air, soil, biodiversity as well as use of energy and water. These commitments are set out in legally binding contracts known as RCAs2 and are audited by the Environmental Superintendency (SMA) on a regular basis. Non-compliance can result in fines or even revocation of operating permits. Environmental commitments are managed in an environmental requirements management system on a platform for the whole mining division. Antofagasta Minerals has a total of 61 RCAs listing 7,145 environmental commitments. We received no environmental fines in 2017. The Los Pelambres Expansion Project was approved in 2018, generating a new RCA and environmental commitments. It is currently under construction. 1 The most important environmental institutions in Chile are the Ministry of Environment which sets out public policy; the Environmental Evaluation Service SEA (Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental) which assesses and qualifies project impacts; the Environmental Superintendency SMA (Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente) which inspects and controls; and the environmental courts which, through the judiciary, apply the General Environment Law and its associated regulations. 2 Resolución de Calificación Ambiental (Environmental Qualification Resolutions). We have a Corporate Integrated Closure of Mining Operations Standard in place since 2016 that considers the physical and chemical stability of the facilities as well as environmental and social issues. It also provides tools for timely and effective closure planning, approval by the authority and communication with the community. There are also guidelines on risk evaluation, social and environmental impacts, economic matters and post-closure guarantees, among other issues. All of our operations have closure plans approved by SERNAGEOMIN, the Chilean government agency responsible for this matter. Our mining operations have emergency response and action plans coordinated with public service and local authorities. Tailings deposits and other facilities are designed to resist earthquakes and extreme climate events. Mining activity generates particulate matter emissions. In Chile there are regulations that establish legal parameters for air quality which differ for urban and rural areas. Antofagasta Minerals’ operations proactively manage air quality through continuous operational measures to suppress dust and particulate matter emissions (eg dampening roads and ore stockpiles), and also have early warning and air-quality monitoring points defined with the authority. However, despite these measures, our controls are not always able to prevent particulate matter emissions from affecting neighbours. In July 2018, the communities of Valle Alto in Salamanca municipal district expressed their concern about an increase in dust from the sector between Los Quillayes tailings dam and Los Pelambres. Although we have worked collaboratively since 2008 to control and minimise the generation of particulate matter, as defined in the Framework Agreement (2008) and Cuncumén 2030 commitment plan (2015), the communities believed it necessary to agree additional activities or modifications. In this context, the communities, local authorities and Los Pelambres signed a document enabling agreement in principle to be reached on a petition of 11 points relating to particulate matter control measures presented by the communities and to generate the basis on which to begin a dialogue process centred on transparency and good faith. Through dialogue with the community, a series of technically feasible measures were jointly developed to mitigate and improve controls of particulate matter. These measures were embodied in an agreement signed in October 2018 between Cuncumén and Batuco communities and Los Pelambres. To date, implementation of the agreed measures is in line with the work plan agreed with the community. These include the construction of a dome to cover ore stockpiles which has been completed and was visited by community representatives and authorities when finalising this report in May 2019. Water is necessary for life and human activities; it is also an essential element to produce copper. Efficient water management must contribute to maintaining the balance between water availability and its use by all parties that coexist in a region, both now and in the future. Water is an essential resource for productive process in mining as well as the development of other human activities. The mining industry uses 3% of total water consumption in Chile1. Although the mining industry is not one of the main water users, it is useful to understand the land-use context of mining operations to assess the different water management challenges. In our case, we have three mining operations – Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar – located in northern Chile and one operation – Los Pelambres - in central Chile. Each region has different water-related challenges although those of climate change and mining sustainably are common to both. All these variables need to be incorporated into our water management system to obtain a better grasp of water issues, establish necessary controls, improve processes and performance, and contribute to solutions for future challenges. In 2018 Antofagasta Minerals adopted ICMM’s Water Stewardship Framework to reinforce our management of water resources. The Water Stewardship Framework is based on four key elements: Be transparent and accountable: Publicly report material water risks, management activities and performance. Engage proactively and inclusively with stakeholders to understand their priorities, share plans and collaborate on solutions. Adopt a catchment-based approach understanding the social, cultural, economic and environmental value of water at the catchment scale to identify material water stewardship risks and provide context for corporate and operational water management. Effective water resource management: Manage operational water (quantity and quality) inputs, use and outputs to maximise resource sustainability, operational flexibility and economic benefit. Within this framework, during the year we reviewed our organisational water management structure. Our new Operational Model describes water management roles and functions. We also 1 Forecast water consumption in copper mining 2017-2028, Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco), 2017. 2 Our report to CDP is publicly available at www.cdp.net held workshops at each of our mining operations with the Risk and Compliance area to identify at risk water resources. This led to the development of a risk matrix with respective controls. The general manager of each operation is responsible for water issues and reports to the Board. The corporate environmental department is responsible for controls, monitoring and incident reporting. Since 2012, we have reported our water management performance in the water chapter of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)2. In recent years our different water challenges have led us to focus on the strategic and efficient planning of water resources that will be necessary to continue our processes on an annual basis, as well as on the incorporation of technologies to minimise continental water use to reduce water consumption per tonne of copper produced. As a mining group we have promoted the use of sea water, developing technologies for its raw use in ore processing operations. In 2018, 45% of our total water consumption came from the sea, significantly higher than 9% a decade ago, when only Michilla used sea water, and also than the Chilean mining industry’s average sea water use of 14%1. Remaining consumption came from surface water (25%), groundwater (29%) and supplied by third parties (1%). Water reuse rates vary between 80% and 96% depending on the characteristics of each operation. This is higher than the Chilean mining industry’s average reuse rate of 75%2. In 2018 we consumed a total of 67.2 million m3 of water, 2% more than the previous year, mainly due to the increase in ore processed. The main loss of water is through natural evaporation from the tailings deposits. We conduct participatory monitoring to ensure water quality outside our sites; in the case of Los Pelambres with the local community. In 2018, we conducted monitoring at 160 points – both ground and surface water – in the Choapa Valley and in the port area. At Centinela and Antucoya, water quality is monitored in the vicinity of the port facilities and at Zaldívar, we monitor groundwater extraction points in Negrillar, close to the Salar de Atacama. In 2018 we carried out a series of water resource protection initiatives at Los Pelambres. Some of the best examples of this are the Aproxima and Confluye programmes, as well as the training of social leaders on rural drinking water issues. In addition, we are conducting a pilot project to help protect the accelerated melting of glaciers. More information on p. 59 1-2 Source: Minería en números 2017, Consejo Minero (Mining in numbers 2017, Mining Council). 3 In 2017 we began implementing the ICMM Water Reporting Guide. The calculation considered factors such as water retained in ore moisture, water at bottom of the pit (ground water according to ICMM methodology), as well as rainfall and run-off (continental water according to ICMM methodology). In the face of climate change, mining not only plays a role as a supplier of copper to promote new low-carbon technologies but also presents a challenge to the industry to decarbonise its production of copper. We will achieve our goals of reducing carbon emissions by incorporating renewable energy and energy efficiencies in our processes. Antofagasta Minerals’ energy use represents almost 21% of cash costs – made up of 14% electricity and 7% fuel – and most of our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. There is a direct link between energy use and GHG emissions when energy is generated from fossil fuels. Chile’s energy policy aims to decarbonise its energy matrix. It has set a target for renewable energy to represent 70% of its energy mix by 2050 and provided economic incentives to reach this goal. In 2018 renewable energy represented 47%1 of the country’s energy matrix. We can make a unique contribution towards these efforts not only because copper is vital for clean energy technologies but also by using renewable energy in our processes and decoupling our energy consumption from GHG emissions. Mining is also very sensitive to the effects of climate change. In recent years we have all been affected by extreme weather events, such as heavy snow, floods and droughts, leading us to adopt an adaptive approach to climate change and focus efforts on technology and innovation. In 2018 Antofagasta Minerals’ Executive Committee approved an updated structure and governance of its Energy Management System. The update emphasises energy management as a key variable to be considered in different initiatives across the organisation including innovation, operational excellence, competitiveness and costs, and as a mechanism for GHG reduction. This involved making adjustments to management structures based on ISO 50001 guidelines and establishing the basis for the new system’s operation. For this purpose, we began different key tasks such as preparing consumption profiles for each operation, analysing the portfolio of Operating Excellence projects to determine the projects’ contribution to reducing energy consumption and GHG emissions, and defined KPIs to measure new projects. 1 Report on Installed Generation Capacity, National Energy Commission, Chile. In addition, in 2018 we continued to drive energy efficiency initiatives including increased performance at the Los Pelambres SAG mill, specific energy consumption improvements at the Centinela electrowinning plant, fuel-use and mining truck utilisation efficiencies at Zaldívar and the evaluation of crusher utilisation rates at Antucoya. In 2019 our tasks are to prepare an electromobility roadmap, create an online corporate energy portal, develop and promote standards that incorporate energy efficiency into project designs and strengthen the governance structure through the Operating Model and highlight energy as an important variable to be considered in decision-making. Our GHG emission reduction goal for 2022 is equivalent to removing around 80,000 vehicles from the roads. The effects of climate change have become evident in Chile in recent years mainly affecting water availability in the centre and north of the country where Antofagasta Minerals’ operations are located. In 2016 the Board approved a Climate Change Standard. The standard has three main aims: Incorporate climate change into organisational culture. Consider GHG emissions in decision-making from the initial design stage of projects until closure. Include GHG mitigation measures, detecting opportunities at operations in electricity supply decisions and project energy efficiencies. In 2018 Antofagasta Minerals also defined a target to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent emissions by 300,000 tonnes by 2022 compared to the baseline in 2017. The Board is responsible for climate change issues and the corporate environmental department for its management. In addition, since 2009 we have reported our climate change management to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).1 In 2018, 23% of Antofagasta Minerals’ energy supply came from renewable energy. At Los Pelambres, one of the world’s largest copper mines, 59% of energy consumption comes from photovoltaic plants, wind or power generated by its ore conveyor belts. As from 2018 new energy supply contracts favour sources that reduce GHG emissions. For example, the new electricity supply contract signed between Zaldívar and Colbún S.A. for 550 GWh/ year will supply renewable energy from July 2020. Zaldívar will be the first Chilean mining company to use 100% renewable energy to produce copper, which will be verified by an external organisation. Another GHG emission reduction initiative is the power increase at Centinela’s thermosolar plant which uses solar energy for heating processes at its electrowinning plant. In 2018 carbon emission intensity decreased by 17% compared to the previous year, mainly due to the combination of the northern SING and central SIC grids. Before the combination, our northern operations obtained electricity from what is now the SING subsystem in which conventional energy sources make up 79% of installed capacity. Our operations now obtain electricity from the national electric system (SEN) in which renewable energy makes up 47% of installed capacity. 1 Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is the leading organisation in the monitoring and disclosure of companies’ carbon and water footprint. More information on www.cdp.net 2 Figures include 100% of Zaldívar emissions although Antofagasta plc owns 50% of the mining operation. 3 Scope 1: Sources of direct emissions in operations controlled by Antofagasta Minerals S.A., such as from machinery, vehicles or boilers. 4 Scope 2: Indirect emissions from electricity generation activities by sources that are owned or controlled by a third party associated with the consumption of energy inputs eg electricity bought from SEN. We are seeking new design, safety and process solutions for the disposal of mining waste by using creativity and innovation and working with others. Chile’s economic and social development is closely connected to mining. One of the consequences of mining is the generation of material which is deposited in waste rock dumps, spent ore dumps and tailings storage facilities. There are around 700 tailings storage facilities in Chile of which 124 are in operation1. Chile’s national geology and mining service SERNAGEOMIN is responsible for inspecting waste disposal facilities, together with other technical bodies – such as the water authority (DGA) – in the regions where mining operations are located. We have four tailings storage facilities in operation: two at Los Pelambres, one at Centinela and one at Zaldívar. They have all been designed with high safety standards, constructed using the downstream method, and are regularly monitored by independent, qualified experts. We also participate in international and public-private alliances to strengthen tailings management at local and global level. Depending on the copper extraction process, mining generates waste which is deposited in tailings storage facilities, waste rock dumps and spent ore dumps, as well as other industrial waste. Each type of waste is managed in accordance with current regulations and with additional measures to protect the safety and health of people and avoid pollution of the soil, and surface and underground water. Antucoya, Centinela Cathodes and Zaldívar mainly generate waste in the form of spent ore from their operations while Los Pelambres and Centinela Concentrates generate tailings; in all cases, waste rock dumps are required. The general manager of each mining operation is responsible for mining waste and reports to the Group’s Board. The corporate environmental department is responsible for controls, monitoring and incident reporting. Since 2015, we have improved communication and warning systems with the community, particularly at the Mauro tailings storage facility. 1 Atlas of Tailing Deposits of Chile – Sernageomin, Chile. Available in Spanish at: http://relaves.sernageomin.cl/#/home Innovation has been a priority for Antofagasta Minerals to achieve new and safe forms of storing tailings. At Centinela, we operate a “thickened” tailings storage facility. This innovation provides significant benefits such as greater physical stability than conventional tailings and enables us to recycle more water to be reused in productive processes. At Los Pelambres we operate the Mauro and Los Quillayes storage facilities (the latter is used as back-up) which were designed to meet high Chilean safety standards and go beyond these in some aspects of their operation. Mauro has 76 water pressure devices (piezometers) to monitor in real time its stability and safety. In September 2015 the Mauro tailings deposit withstood an 8.3° magnitude earthquake 100 km away, the strongest earthquake in the region in more than 70 years. It suffered no negative impacts and continued to operate normally. After the 2015 tailings dam collapse in the district of Bentos Rodrigues de Mariana in Brazil, the mining industry through ICMM reviewed the critical controls for these facilities, which included ensuring the availability and development of qualified and competent human resources. Our tailings storage facilities are reviewed twice a year by a group of independent international experts who assess their condition and management, and report directly to the CEO and Board. As an ICMM member, we support recent proposals to develop an independent, international system of managing tailings deposits. We also actively participate in the ICMM working group on the matter which has two main lines of action: Short term (less than 10 years): Strengthen critical controls for the design, operation and closure of conventional tailings deposits (to be prepared during 2019) and, within a period of no more than 10 years, significantly improve the management of tailings storage facilities and the implementation of ICMM’s Position Statement on tailings. Long term (10 to 15 years): This involves two lines of work. First to investigate and identify alternative methods of ore recovery to significantly reduce and/or eliminate tailings generation. Second, to promote the development of technologies to eliminate moisture from tailings and thus strengthen their geomechanic properties. We also participate in the Consejo Minero’s (Mining Council) tailings working group which is focused on facilitating implementation of the ICMM’s Position Statement in Chile and preparing a guide to develop emergency procedures. The waste rock we remove to extract ore and the spent ore we generate through the leaching process are stored in specially prepared areas within our facilities. In Chile, the location, operation and closure of dumps must be authorised by the environmental authorities and by SERNAGEOMIN. Our processes produce hazardous industrial waste, such as used oil and batteries, and non-hazardous waste, such as sludge and timber. All are managed in accordance with legal requirements. Whenever possible, we recycle waste to avoid its final disposal. In addition to Chile’s strict existing regulations on waste, Law 20,920 came into force in 2017 which established a waste management framework, extended the responsibility of the producer and promoted recycling, which included tyres as a priority waste. Protecting biodiversity and valuable environmental ecosystems. Los Pelambres is located in Coquimbo Region in one of the world’s 25 areas of greatest plant biodiversity, reflected in an abundance of flora and fauna. Our operations located in the Atacama Desert - Centinela, Antucoya and Zaldívar - are in an environment with less flora and fauna. Antofagasta Minerals has a Biodiversity Standard developed in conjunction with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in 2016. It is aligned with the ICMM’s position statement on Biodiversity and Protected Areas and aims to prevent and minimise impacts on biodiversity, appropriately restore and compensate for any such impact, and generate additional benefits in the surrounding area. All of our operations must conduct a review of biodiversity - species and ecosystems - according to the categories established by the Standard to prevent significant impacts and, if this is not possible, to minimise or compensate for them. Los Pelambres currently administers four Nature Sanctuaries in Coquimbo Region: Palma Chilena de Monte Aranda, Quebrada Llau Llau, Laguna Conchalí and Cerro Santa Inés. Laguna Conchalí is a coastal wetland with a high conservation value and a highly unique habitat for the establishment and development of terrestrial and aquatic plant and animal life. Los Pelambres has administered it since 1997 with the aim of restoring and protecting the environment. 14 sites in Chile and the only one managed by a private company. The sanctuary is located 4 km north of Los Vilos and covers 50.4 hectares (the surface area of the RAMSAR site is 34 hectares). In 2018, a new environmental management plan was developed together with the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and approved by the Ministry of Environment that will further strengthen this site’s environmental richness. In 2018 we contributed to the protection of about 27,000 hectares of high-conservation land through a management model, allowing us to safeguard its conservation and strengthen its rich biodiversity. Santa Inés is a 714-hectare coastal site which has one of the last remnants of relict rainforest, meaning that it contains plant and animal life that used to exist in the wider area but which has shrunk due to climate change. This nature sanctuary co- vers more than 5,696 hecta- res and has populations of the Palma Chilena (Jubaea chilensis), a threatened endemic palm species. Its conservation status is “vul- nerable” and it is regarded as one of the southernmost palms in the world. There are also almost 100 species of native flora and fauna, among other common and endemic species. Almost 1,800 hectares protect this sclerophyllous “hard-leaved” woodland ecosystem in the mediterranean-climate ecoregion found in central Chile. Its preserves some of the region’s endangered species such as the Chequén (Luma chequen or white Chilean Myrtle) and the Canelo (Drymis winteri). We have a set of indicators to measure and evaluate our sustainability performance. Some of these indicators are included in the business scorecards of each mining operation and our corporate offices while others are aspirational goals that we have defined to complement these targets. Zero fatalities|1|0Regrettably one of our contractors at Los Pelambres had a fatal accident.| 1.1 Implemented according to plan and without delays. 1.0 Implement plan milestones without delays in accordance with Strategy.

The Group’s risk appetite was defined and approved. Due diligence on Human Rights began. Review and communicate the Group’s Compliance Model. Define the Group’s risk appetite. Conduct due diligence on Human Rights. During the year, the Compliance Model was reviewed and its structure was updated. It was rolled out through a day workshop for executives, a corporate video and mass emails across the organisation. In 2019 a mass e-learning process is planned and specific training for more exposed areas. In 2018 the Board reviewed and approved the Group’s risk appetite in the main risk areas, providing guidelines to the administration on how to analyse and control our main risks. Due diligence on Human Rights began at the end of 2018 at all our mining operations. The key issues reported in our Sustainability Report are defined through a formal Materiality Analysis process, involving Antofagasta Minerals’ CEO and executive team. For our 2018 Materiality Analysis, we conducted a review and update of the issues that were material to Antofagasta Minerals in 2017. The key issues were identified through the following activities: Strategic and priority issues for Antofagasta Minerals: these were identified through interviews with the CEO and the Vice President of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability. The Business Strategy, Sustainability Policy and Risk Matrix were also reviewed. Principal issues for external stakeholders: these were identified through a review of internal and external communications media, the latter mainly focused on the mining sector. Critical issues for specialist investors and analysts on sustainability were also identified. · Emerging issues for the mining sector and companies in general: key emerging issues for Antofagasta Minerals were identified by reviewing different sources of specialist information. The most important issues identified were analysed and classified according to “importance to stakeholders” and the “size of impact”. The Materiality Matrix in the 2017 Sustainability Report was used as a basis for the evaluation as well as an assessment of the issues in the Risk Matrix. The main messages and audience to whom the Report is addressed were defined together with the CEO. Workshops were held with vice presidents and key executives on the management of material issues to define the management approach, initiatives and indicators to be highlighted. Achieving the Agenda 2030 targets will require cooperation between the State, local government, private sector and civil society. At Antofagasta Minerals, we seek to contribute to the achievement of these goals through our operations, projects and programmes. Messrs. Shareholders and Directors Antofagasta Minerals S.A. We have reviewed the set of performance indicators contained in pages 76 to 79 of Antofagasta Minerals S.A.’s 2018 Sustainability Report, hereinafter, “Performance Indicators”, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Antofagasta Minerals S.A.’s management is responsible for the presentation of the Performance Indicators in accordance with the definitions established in the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI standards). Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Performance Indicators based on our review. Our review was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the Chilean Institute of Public Accountants. Those standards require that we plan and perform the review, to obtain limited assurance about whether any material modifications should be made to the Performance Indicators, in order to be in accordance with the definitions established in the GRI standards. A review is substantially less in scope than an examination, the objective of which is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Performance Indicators are in accordance with the definitions established in the GRI standards, in all material respects, in order to express an opinion. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. We believe that our review provides a reasonable basis for our conclusion. We performed, among others, the following procedures: work planning according to relevance and volume of the information of the Performance Indicators; interviews with different executives responsible for the information provided for the Performance Indicators; review, based on testing, that the data for the Performance Indicators is consistent with the documentary evidence reviewed and/or comes from verifiable supporting information sources; review that the financial information included as part of the Performance Indicators is derived from accounting records or from financial statements as of December 31, 2018, audited by a firm of independent auditors. review of the presentation of the Performance Indicators in the 2018 Sustainability Report. The reviewed Performance Indicators are detailed on pages 76 to 79 of the 2018 Sustainability Report. Based on our review, we are not aware of any significant modifications that should be made to the Performance Indicators of Antofagasta Minerals S.A. for the year ended December 31, 2018, presented in the 2018 Sustainability Report, in order to be in accordance with the definitions established in the sustainability reporting standards of the Global Reporting Initiative.
